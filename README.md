# Old-Projects
A repo containing some projects from over the last year.

We have a selection of projects I've worked on over the last year in various states of completion. These were originally made just for me so they need to be polished up slightly before they are fit for public consumption.

Crypto - A project from around Jan 2021 for predicting crypto-currency prices.
Scraper - Originally designed to scrape hotel prices from Booking.com shelved over concerns about legality.
ScreenCatch - There are number of channels on TikTok which garner viewers by scratching gift cards live on air. The money goes to the first person to claim the card. This project detects and saves text to clipboard automatically. It uses as it's foundation the open source vision software Tesseract OCR.
