# Old-Projects
A repo containing some projects from over the last year.

We have a selection of projects I've worked on over the last year in various states of completion. These were originally made just for me so they need to be polished up slightly before they are fit for public consumption.

Crypto - A project from around Jan 2021 for predicting crypto-currency prices.

Scraper - Originally designed to scrape hotel prices from Booking.com shelved over concerns about legality.

ScreenCatch - There are number of channels on TikTok which garner viewers by scratching gift cards live on air. The money goes to the first person to claim the card. This project detects and saves text to clipboard automatically. It uses as it's foundation the open source vision software Tesseract OCR.

PixelArt - Often on social media people present art which has been assembled by combining a number of discrete objects. Examples include art formed from Rubix cubes, dice or sticky notes. I thought, given some finite discrete palette of colours and a target image, can we write a program which produces an image using these colours which is 'near' to this target. In this way we can use this as a colour-by-numbers to help us produce similar art. Below is a picture of a dog made out of coloured thumbtacks made using this method.
